      notes: "all base expectations fulfilled; added one interactive element.
              admin menu able to be edited w/o being logged in as administrator.
              some acceptance tests (creating user, creating menu items), but unit tests missing.
              used all http verbs; some mixing of web & business logic.
              views used layouts and partials to avoid code replication.
              many concerns about order of lessons and lack of important concepts in lessons."

    instructor_evaluation:
      notes: "recreated original site; added banner, contact, reservation, and reviews.
              admin able to edit items (name, size, price, image).
              saw good testing at feature level; would like to see more things tested in isolation.
              good divisions of logic and encapsulation; content store probably could  have been broken into a repository and a seracher.
              easy to read and follow code.
              saw use of layout and partials to avoid code duplication; did not see use of helpers.
