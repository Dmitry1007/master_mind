      notes: "Well tested, but missing some business logic. Tests are consistent and thorough. 
              Excellent encapsulation and breaking lotic into components -- just not complete with business logic. 
              Code is easy to read; structured well.
              Well-chosen enumerables; one place where could have chained enumerables. Would like to see business logic to get 4.
              No problems with line length or confusing methods/variable names."

    instructor_evaluation:
      notes: "Some business logic implemented (9 out of 12), but some functionality missing. 7 failing tests when running spec harness.
              High-level integration tests are present, but would like to see more isolation and smaller-level integration tests. 
              Responsibilities are broken down, but some classes rely to heavily on others (repositories loading their own data).
              Effort towards clarity and refactoring -- some confusingly-named variables, some long methods.
              Good use of varied enumerables; some instances where enumerables were chained where one would have worked.
              Code sanitation good -- method names, line length good. "
