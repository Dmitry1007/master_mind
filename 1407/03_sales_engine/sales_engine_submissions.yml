      notes: "Well tested, but missing some business logic. Tests are consistent and thorough. 
              Excellent encapsulation and breaking lotic into components -- just not complete with business logic. 
              Code is easy to read; structured well.
              Well-chosen enumerables; one place where could have chained enumerables. Would like to see business logic to get 4.
              No problems with line length or confusing methods/variable names."
