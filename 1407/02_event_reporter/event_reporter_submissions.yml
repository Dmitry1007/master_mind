    notes: "Some test cases execute properly.
            Good implementation of fundamental finding, printing.
            Doesn't handle some edge cases.
            Tests don't run, needs better coverage.
            Decomposition is good.
            Ruby is overall strong, but tries to do too much in places.
            Good use of enumerable methods."
