#### A one stop shop for meal planning and sharing designed around the Whole Health approach to diet management.

[1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would 
you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?]

#### This app provides a dynamic recipie collection following the directives of the top 3 current Whole Health dietary plans. Users can browse recipies, leave feed back, and submit their own. Where this app differs is in the fact that it will create comprehensive shopping lists based on a menu set that they choose. So they can design their own meal plan, get the shopping list. And lastly it will provide them with information on local shopping options for farmers markets and store in their area including price prediction vs. ingredient quality.

#### This app will target the back to basics eater, there is a huge movement toward slow food in the US that brings people back into the kitchen, and promotes Whole Health eating. This movement has a focus on anti-inflamitory eating, designed at combatting auto-immunity instability. Everyone from top-tier athletes to people with serious health issues such as Crons, down to happy healthy familys that want to promote a new generation of healthy habits would be a potential user. The US obesity rates are among the highest in the world, and while there are more and more resources out there, so many of them make this type of eating too much of an adventure for the average person. Meal bug takes the adventure out of it, give users the tools they need to make this transition as easy as possible.

### The Bookist

#### Imagine a library that was connected to your mailbox!

#### The local LMC is becoming a thing of the past, especially considering the impact that book bans and censorship has. What if you could find books that you wanted or needed of all types, fiction, non-fiction, resources, textbooks, etc! As a member of the site you would pay a monthly membership fee. That fee would allow you to find privately owned books held by other users and request a checkout. As a book owner, you would post your books on the site for others to browse. Others would then checkout your books, as a part of your membership you would be provided with pre-paid media mail for x-# of books per month. The shipping label would come from the check-out-ers account. And it would be up to the book owner to then print the label and send the book. Kind of like an ebay LMC. Certain limitations could be put on the book loan; ie: permanent loan, term loan (set by borrower), standard book month (4 week term), at which time the borrower would either keep the book, or send it back. If the book return is not confirmed there would be a cost penalty assessed to the borrow based on the determined value of the book. Additional money could be applied to an account for more books, and certain books like text books would have an additional fee as they would not be able to be sent via US media-mail.

[1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would

#### So current streaming music is dope, but it's missing ONE KEY PART! The ability to share your stream, what if you could create a pandora like station, but then invite others to listen to your station, which would then sync the tunes for both users so that they could enjoy the same songs at the same time.
