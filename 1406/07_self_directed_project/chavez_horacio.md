This is my favorite.

#### Pitch

People enjoy to ride their bikes, but they're going to love it when they can make friends doing that nation wide.  
_Good reasons, but it's a weak statement._

#### Description

According to the National Bicycle Association, during 2013 were sold 16.2 million bikes with direct effect
sales of $5.8 billions. So yes, people in US loves ride their bikes. But there is a gap between today's connectivity
and this market. That's why we need to develop a tool which gives freedom to riders. From designing new
routes, and know the weather of the road to actually create meetups and races nation wide.
