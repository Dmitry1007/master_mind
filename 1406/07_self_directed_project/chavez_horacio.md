### healthiness

#### Pitch
Enjoy having a healthy and different shopping list every day!

#### Description

Let's face it, almost any one loves to buy groceries, and is not because you don't want to go shopping, it's
because you don't know exactly what to buy. But what if you have someone which tells you the "healthiness"
of every product, and even better, it also let you know how many of it you need to buy until your next
shopping day!

#### Target Audience
people with tight schedule.
desk jobs.  
28 - 45 years old.  

#### Integrations
Google OAuth - almost everyone have a Gmail (https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2)
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dietary-guidelines-for-americans-2010)

#### Risk
It also need a reliable dataset of codebars to match the product, and then find their Nutritional Facts.
At this time, I don't have a source to match the products with their Nutritional Facts, other than scrapping.
