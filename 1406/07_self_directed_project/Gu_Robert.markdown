#### Pitch

[1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would 
you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?]

A set of tools to dominate your weekly or yearly fantasy football league.

#### Description


[5-8 sentences about the application, what it'll do, and why it should exist

The applications main function will be to generate a variety of teams
that will score the most fantasy points that week based on the algorithim we 
create.  Other side functions of the application will track a variety of
algorithims prediction models vs randomly generated teams to see which models
are most accurate. Other tools the application will provide is to generate
a variety of top 10 lists for each position based on this season statistics
based on standard league scoring, PPR, and also based on DraftKings unique
scroring system. It should exsist because there is $$$ to be made
#### Target Audience

The target audience is anyone that needs a better set of tools for
better predicting the week to week results of fantasy sports.

            Facebook is the OAuth provider that makes most sense since almost everyone has
            it. There is a Yahoo OAuth but there is none for ESPN and NFL.  
            
            FFnerd API is something I am already subscribed to that I can use.  It does 
            retrieve up to date statistics for players but not realtime statistics(which is
            something I don't need).  Also there is a site SportsData which I am going 
            to use as the base for my alorithim.
            
            
            
            
            #### Idea 2
            #### Pitch
            A website that track a college students attendance in a variety of school
            school activties and that students recieves badges and rewards for their 
            particpation.  This would increase student involvement, help achieve higher
            retention rates at schools.
            
            #### Description
            What I'm build is just the software component, but we would use maybe RFID
            technology to track if students have been to class, football games, and
            we can have a page that a student can see all the different classes, and
            activties they have attended and compare that with their friends.  The real
            value proposition comes from admissions being able to get a list of students
            that have a low overall particpation in student activties, and assign someone
            to meet with them.  Retaining students saves students a lot of money.  
            Admissions can also get higher level information about how the overall
            campus is doing as a whole.  What classes are most attended? Least attended?
            
            #### Target Audience
            Any university that is having a hard time with either student particpation and
            /or student retnetion.

            Here I think the facebook OAuth makes the most sense.  It is the most
            widely used I would assume across the people this tool is targeted towards.
            
            I tried looking for an API that has retention rates for universities but had
            no luck after 30 mins.  I'm sure I can use something from Data.Gov that
            compares your universties retnetion rates to the national average, or state 
            by state.

            Flashlight.  An app that tracks where and what times crimes occur in your city.
            
            #### Description
            Using public city data about crimes, have maps that are lighter in areas
            that are safer and darker in areas where crime occurs most often.  Users can
            enter in zipcodes that give them information about that area that then
            gives them a rating of how safe that are is relative to other places in city. 
            #### Target Audience
            People that are looking for houses can look up safety information about that
            hood.  Maybe if you are new to the city and you are curious at just getting
            an overall view of safety of the city you can look here.  
            
            #### Integrations
            I can use the public data available.  Data SF has an API about a lot of their
            cities information, and crime data is public.  I also thought about integration
            with zillows API that way you can find homes that are nearby your search area.
