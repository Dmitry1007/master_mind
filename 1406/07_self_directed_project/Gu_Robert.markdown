#### Idea 1
#### Pitch
A simple application that sends you a SMS notice that lets you know
what type of clothes you might need to wear for the day.
#### Description
Based on the weather forcast for the rest of the day, this app will
simply let you know if you need a jacket or umbrella for the day ahead!
No need to check the weather anymore.
#### Target Audience
For those that don't keep a jacket and raincoat on them very often.
#### Integrations

Facebook is used widely across a lot of people so might be most useful.

I would use weather undergroud or weather base as the API to help decide to 
use this app or not.

#### Idea 2
#### Pitch
Name that tune game, based on category two users compete to name the tune
in a certain amount of seconds

#### Description
Based of the popular gameshow from the late 80's players compete to name that
tune bidding back and forth and trying to fill in the answer correctly.

#### Target Audience
Any music lovers looking to have a little fun!

#### Integrations


Here I think the facebook OAuth makes the most sense.  It is the most
widely used I would assume across the people this tool is targeted towards.

This would make use of the spotify API and also lyricsfiy API to gather
information about the songtitle and artist.


#### IDEA 3

#### Pitch

Homebuyer, shows you information about schools and level of crime around
the house you are trying to buy.



#### Description
People can enter in a zipcode and see homes that are in that area. It will show
homes that have the price, crime level around that area, and also how
the schools are rated around that area as well. Other features would let you
sort by price, bedrooms, crime, best schools.  
#### Target Audience
Target audience in home buyers that are also concerned about schools in that 
area and also crime rates as well.
#### Integrations
I can use the public data available.  Data SF has an API about a lot of their
cities information, and crime data is public.  I also thought about integration
with zillows API that way you can find homes that are nearby your search area.

I think I would use facebook gain for OAuth for this audience. 


#### Idea 4
An application that looks for both a brewery and food truck, and based
on combined yelp ratings gives you best place to get a beer and some food.

#### Description
Someone can search by zip, type of food, or type of beer, and filter the
results of breweries and food trucks returned.  By default it will
return the best food truck brewery combo of the day.  It will pictures
of both the brewery and food truck loaded onto the page, and also easy
to read menus for both places. 

#### Target Audience
People looking for something to eat and drink after work.

#### Integrations
This will mainly use Yelps API but also use googlemaps to give location
information as well.  Also it will need to integrate twitter APIs so we
can find the locations of those food trucks as well.
