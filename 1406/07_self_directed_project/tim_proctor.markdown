## Idea 1:

### PAs (Public Announcements)

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here]

#### Pitch

Listen to your pre-selected public announcement on any specific light rail train.

#### Description

What if you could select the train, time, and nature of an announcement made on
a light rail train? Choose from some stock messages like:
- "Dan wishes Darlene a Happy 34th Birthday"
  "Dan and Darlene wish the Broncos good-luck today"
  "Nabisco wishes everyone a happy holidays"
  "Dan wants to ask Darlene a very important question."
  "Darlene wants to tell Dan how sorry she is."

#### Target Audience

Anyone on the train. Must be suitable for all.

#### Integrations

I would imagine that there are strict guidelines as to when and what content
can be announced publicly. Trains need to be able to announce every stop, but
there is time in between stops for maybe one to two messages. There would need
to be some integration with RTD, and I'm not sure what that would be. Twitter
would be a cool OAuth provider.

* [What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience?]
* [What Data.gov data or API will you use?]
* [Any other integrations?]

## Idea 2:

### Baby Named

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here]

#### Pitch

Whether you're interested in following the trends or purposely avoiding them,
Baby Named can give you the name of your next child.

#### Description

Tell Baby Named whether you want a "trending" or "non-trending" name. Customers
can post what names they plan on using, so people can compare the "trends" with
the conversation threads.

#### Target Audience

Parents to be.

#### Integrations

OAuth: Twitter and Amazon
Data: Still working on finding through Social Security Admin. 


## Idea: 3

### WatchOut!

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here]

#### Pitch

Want to know which intersections are the most dangerous for pedestrians
bicyclists in Denver?

#### Description

Get real time information about recent accidents at searched for intersections
between drivers and pedestrians or drivers and bicyclists.

#### Target Audience

People worried about getting hit or those curious about dangerous intersections.

#### Integrations

I would use OAuth for Twitter and Amazon but not sure if there is this information
on Data.gov or if it lives at the local level.


## Idea: 4

### TellMeWhen

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here]

Want to stay current on child safety related recalls but don't have the time?

#### Description

TellMeWhen will give those that sign-up a text message alert when a recall has
been updated.

#### Target Audience
