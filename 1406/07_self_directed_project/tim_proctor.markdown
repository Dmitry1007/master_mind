### PAs

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here]

#### Pitch

Listen to your pre-selected public announcement on any specific light rail train.

#### Description

What if you could select the train, time, and nature of an announcement made on
a light rail train? Choose from some stock messages like:
- "Dan wishes Darlene a Happy 34th Birthday"
  "Dan and Darlene wish the Broncos good-luck today"
  "Nabisco wishes everyone a happy holidays"
  "Dan wants to ask Darlene a very important question."
  "Darlene wants to tell Dan how sorry she is."

#### Target Audience

Anyone on the train. Must be suitable for all.

#### Integrations

I would imagine that there are strict guidelines as to when and what content
can be announced publicly. Trains need to be able to announce every stop, but
there is time in between stops for maybe one to two messages. There would need
to be some integration with RTD, and I'm not sure what that would be.

* [What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience?]
* [What Data.gov data or API will you use?]
* [Any other integrations?]
