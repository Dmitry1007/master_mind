### [Project Title]

housesreallyarentallthathard.com (I'm not good at titles)

#### Pitch

A one-stop shop for homeowners to research, organize, and plan home maintenance,
whether it be DIY or through a service.

#### Description

The goal is to simplify the process of maintaining a home (especially for new
homeowners).  There will be lots of general information about what kinds of services
one might need (plumbing, electricity, taxes, etc.), in addition to the ability
to search for relevant services in your area.  Then, users will be able to create
a "checklist", where they can "save" a particular service and have a convenient place
to find information like phone numbers.  Users can also add notes to a particular
checklist item, allowing them to organize tasks related to home maintenance.

#### Target Audience

One of the main targets is new homeowners, but really it would be useful for
anyone who wants to organize the process of maintaining a home and have relevant
information in one central location.

#### Integrations

* [What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience?]
OAuth with google makes the most sense to me, but ideally I would include the option
of Google/Facebook/Twitter

* [What Data.gov data or API will you use?]
A real estate API of some kind

* [Any other integrations?]
Google maps integration to give some sense of where services (plumbers/electricians)
are located

### [Project Title]

SimpleDota

#### Pitch

An extremely simple interface for browsing content related to Dota 2, with support
for user-generated content like builds and articles.

#### Description

The Dota 2 wiki is currently the best place for information related to Dota
such as hero abilities and items.  It's a great tool, but the problem is that I
have to sift through what feels like so much unecessary information and space
to find what I need.  Ability descriptions are often multiple sentences.  It's
currently impossible to have all 4 abilities for a hero on screen at once.  The
goal is to create an extremely simple interface for browsing content, and
extend this interface into displaying user generated content such as builds for
certain heroes.  Ane example use case would be users pulling up SimpleDota for
a match, having a quick, obvious, and easy reference to the information they'll
need.

#### Target Audience

People who play dota, using SimpleDota as a reference whether it be in-game or out of game.

#### Integrations

* [What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience?]
I think the google/facebook/twitter trifecta makes the most sense here as well.
At the very least there is nothing that really stands out as being the "obvious"
choice for OAuth provider.

* [What Data.gov data or API will you use?]
I couldn't come up with any decent data.gov data, but the dota 2 api has
lot's of fun stats like win rates.

* [Any other integrations?]
Integration with the Dota 2 API will be likely, for example for things like
patch notes

Managing notes through github

#### Pitch

Use a web interface combined with a github repository to keep track of notes
while learning to program.

#### Description

Learning to program through self-study is an increasingly viable option with the vast
ocean of both free and paid online resources.  The trouble, especially with things
like shorter blog-style tutorials, is that it can be tough to keep track of every
source you are leaning from.  The goal here is to have a simple interface where you
can add and track a list of learning resources, organize them in meaningful ways, and
associate them with notes (ideally github-flavored markdown) via a github repository.
Users will also be able to create their own custom learning goals from their chosen
resources.

#### Target Audience

The main target is people learning to program.  That could be total beginners, but
more experienced developers could also benefit from a tool like this in learning
new technologies.

#### Integrations

* [What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience?]
This is the only idea I have that sort of screams a particular OAuth, which would
be github.

* [What Data.gov data or API will you use?]

* [Any other integrations?]
