      notes: "It would have been nice to see categories separated into their own table, so they could be linked up by id.
              Having to manually type the category name when adding a menu item leaves a lot of potential for typos.
              Would have been nice to see some unit tests.
              Contacting and applying both send mail. Maybe there's room to extract out the mailing functionality into a Mailer class?
              Not comfortable with the MenuDB.new logic in the view. Would have been cool to see a helper used or maybe locals passed in instead."
