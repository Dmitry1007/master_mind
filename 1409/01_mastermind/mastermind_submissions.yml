    notes: "Shows strong effort toward organization. Some closely-coupled objects.
            Good use of best-choice enumerables (collect, any? zip).
            Well-tested in isolation and integration.
            Integrated difficulty level in REPL. Clear to use.
            Saw intent to break apart logical components, but some objects tied together that will make future iterations or changes difficult to implement."

    notes: "Don't kill me...
            Complex code with long methods, but saw logic ____.
            Saw map and include?; used .each for generating color sequence (look into better choice enumerable).
            Small, encapsulated classes had solid tests, but game_manager was difficult because of too much going on.
            Game was pleasant to play, but did not always behave as expected.
            Pulled out input, printer, color sequence, and guess checker into small, manageable classes; would like to see game manager separated into objects that perform certain responsibilities.
