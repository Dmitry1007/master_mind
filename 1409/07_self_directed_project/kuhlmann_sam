## Farm-to-tableorama

### Pitch

I need a single referece point for finding locally sourced food in my area. Additonally, I grow a lot of food and would love a way to trade and share with people in my community.

Features
+ Fresh food directory (maybe with a map)
+ User profile and ability to list your local food product
