### Car2yo

### Pitch

Carpool finder app for the car2go carsharing service.

### Problem

I am a frequent user of car2go but I’m always a solo driver, though I know that there are people in my neighborhood who also commute to and from downtown at similar times. There should be an app to coordinate rides with fellow car2go users.

### Solution

Carpool coordination via an easy to use app would allow drivers to be greener (fewer cars on the road) and split fares/save money. Potential side bonus: meeting other people who live in your community.

### Target Audience

My target user doesn’t have their own car and instead relies on car and bike sharing options to get from A to B. This user enjoys the convenience of car2go but would like to be even more environmentally responsible and also cut costs.

### Integrations

* OAuth 2.0 (still researching)
* car2go API, possibly Twitter
* Google Maps (still researching)
