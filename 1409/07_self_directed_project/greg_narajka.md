Better Reads

### Pitch

Better Reads generates book ratings and recommendations based on the interests of people with whom the user is more likely to align. 

### Problem

Aggregate ratings from large numbers of people are useful when shopping for a consumer product or deciding on a restaurant for dinner, but taste in books is idiosyncratic. The judgment of the right person is often more valuable than the thousand practically anonymous reviews you normally find on GoodReads. 

### Solution

This app will focus on matching the user with other like-minded users, rather than recommending individual books. I'd also very much like to generate alternate ratings based on the opinions of followed users, but that depends on the limitations of the API.

### Target Audience

People with fairly settled taste in books.

### Integrations

GoodReads OAuth if possible, otherwise Facebook OAuth (which Goodreads already uses)
GoodReads API
